PartyInfoBox: A comprehensive party information display addon for FFXI

MAIN FEATURES:
- Real-time party member position tracking (P1, A1, A2)
- Distance calculations between player and party members
- Character state detection (idle, moving, engaged, resting, etc.)
- Target tracking for all party members
- Distance calculations to targets
- Customizable column display options
- Demo mode for testing and configuration
- Focus-based update control

ARCHITECTURE:
This is the main entry point that coordinates all functionality through helper modules.
The helper pattern provides clean separation of concerns:
- helpers_config: Settings and configuration management
- helpers_display: Text overlay rendering and formatting
- helpers_party: Party data collection and caching
- helpers_utils: Utility functions for calculations and checks
- helpers_events: Event handling and update logic
- helpers_commands: Chat command processing
- helpers_demo: Demo mode simulation
- helpers_chat: Chat message formatting

GLOBAL STATE:
- player_id: Current player's unique identifier
- demo_mode: Whether the addon is in demo/test mode
